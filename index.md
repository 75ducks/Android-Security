## Green Zone Security
1. Use a VPN
2. Keep apps to a minimum
3. set sim card pin


I choose using a VPN because as long as you can afford the subscription fee they are simple to use, a great way to remain anonymous so you can't be tracked online, help with preventing malware from doing its task, and many come with ad blockers.  Keeping apps to a minimum is another very simple and effective form of security.  Using fewer apps means there are fewer chances for an information breach because fewer organizations or people will have your information.  Putting a pin on your sim card is easy and means if someone steals your phone won't be able to access your contacts.  This security measure is more for others because if someone has your sim they can send fraudulent messages to all of your contacts posing as you.

## Yellow Zone Security
1. Two-factor authentication
2. use multiple accounts on one device
3. turn off Bluetooth

Two-factor authentication will make it much harder for anyone trying to steal your account or information to be successful.  Using multiple accounts on a device allows different parts of your life to be separate so that if one of your accounts is breached you are only showing a part of your information.  Bluetooth is not secure and allows your location to be tracked. Sadly because aux ports are being taken out Bluetooth is now necessary for many people.

## Red Zone Security
1. Disable your GPS and location
2. Remove your physical mic and camera
3. Switch to a custom OS

Disabling your GPS and location can be a pain for going anywhere or having an app that needs a location but disabling them means you will be much more difficult to track.  Removing your mic and camera guarantees you won't be spied on and you can still use a mic by using earbuds or a headset.  Switching to a custom OS can help block out google which probably gathers more information than anything else if you have an android.
